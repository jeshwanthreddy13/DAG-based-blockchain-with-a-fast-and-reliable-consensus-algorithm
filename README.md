Proof of democracy 

This new consensus algorithm works for a blockchain which is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph. the node(N) is contains details of a particular transaction.
In order for N to be accepted into the Graph it has to be validated by a minister. A minister is someone who has the rights to insert a vertex into the 
chain. The ministers are considered trustworthy and are elected in a democratic manner. To insert a vertex N into a chain we first need to validate vertexes
from N - 1 to N - k(Where k makes N-k the last vertex in that particular chain) this is done to make sure that the chain is not corrupt by illegal 
transactions.Now for the validator to insert thevertex a number of coins need to be staked, this ensures that the urge to validate an illegal transaction 
is avoided. A vertex with the least number of edges has the higest reward.

Lets understand the role of a citizen and his contributions to safeguard the blockchain.
A citizen is someone who checks a particular chain to make sure that it doesn't have any illegal transactions. Citizens do not insert any vertex nor are
they allowed to. Their insentives to safeguard the DAG is nothing but the interest to protect the DAG for mutual interest of a safe blackchain. The reasons
as to why we are not providing any coins as incentives is due to the fact that citizens may want coins for nothing. This may urge them to declare a legal 
transaction as illegal. Benefits of a Directed acyclic graph is that the citizens need not validate all the vetexes, but with respect to the 
chain length. Since a DAG has many chains a citizen may only validate the one according to his chice. Hence this eliminates the need for a citizen to have
high computational power. 

The benefits of this consensus algorithm are as follows.
1)If a vertex does not have many directed edges toward it, it may imply that its an illegal transaction and validators are avoiding it so as to protect 
their staked amount. 
2)Ministers in the urge to avoid losing their rights to insert a vertex and hence lose incentives and staked coins promotes them to only validate correct 
chains. Hence this ensures mass participation by ministers to validate an illegal chain is low. This helps the citizens to check that particular chain since 
it is not very long as many validators have not validated it.
3)If a citizen finds that the chain is illegal he can call a vote. All participating citizens vote and the required action is taken(More on the voting
and replacing in the next section). This helps increase the reputation of a citizen and promotes a citizen to a minister. 
4)Since it is a DAG, inserting multiple transactions(vertex's) at once can be achieved, as vertex's can be added to multiple different chains without bothering about
the other chains. This increases parallizations and promotes sharding.
5)The reward system ensures that all chains are validated plentifully by the minister and citizens and no chain is left without proper validation. 
Since a chain with the least length is faster to compute and has the highest rewards.
